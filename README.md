# Conditional GAN for stl10
PyTorch implementation of [Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1784) for [STL-10 dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~acoates/stl10/).<br>
This implementation is based on Convolution network and the code refer to [DCGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434).

## Environments
- Python 3.7.9
- PyTorch 1.3.1
- IPython 7.18.1
- Pillow 8.0.0

## Usage
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Tiger-0512/conditionalGAN-stl10.git
```
and [run a notebook server](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/public_server.html) to access the notebook.

## Notes
Change the path of the dataset in 9th code cell as you like.
